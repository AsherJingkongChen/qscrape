## What is it for?

With `qscrape`, you can explore the Web easily. This scraper will continuously bring you web pages. Reading text on the console is all you need to do.

We've provided a **command line tool** and a **library** for you, which are simple to use. You can obtain `qscrape` from NPM. Please see the section [`How to Obtain`](#how-to-obtain).
